  <h1>Why We Serve</h1>

  <p>
    I’m a millennial, entrepreneur, and founder of Paradigm Wealth Architects. I started this practice to help change the perception of our generation through your talents, visions, and accomplishments. Sound crazy? We believe that each generation is able to transcend the consciousness of the previous generation, making the world a more compassionate, just, and unified place for future generations – this truth drives me to connect with people on a substantive level that is uncommon. Instead of interacting with each other on a transactional level, our focus is to continue to lead the financial planning profession in a direction that truly puts our client’s well-being first. We are passionate about performing financial planning in this capacity because we know that every single human being has the potential to make a tremendous impact on the world. Energy from every interaction ripples through social groups, so if we can help each of our client better versions of themselves…. Finish this when in a better headspace.

  <h5>Firm Values</h5>
  <p>
    If we aren’t learning we aren’t growing, and I do not believe that I can serve you as a fiduciary if I am not actively seeking knowledge and wisdom.
    Importance of being evidence-based and using science in what we do.
    This goes beyond financial planning. Our awareness/consciousness, if not purposefully worked on, can limit our ability to think clearly and creatively.
    Exploring ideas outside of money – learning about philosophy, science, history, etc. because society didn’t happen in a vacuum.
    Making the World a Better Place... Need to continue building these out and add to the list – maybe distill into 4 key pillars.

    In determining which aspects of our service offering you’d like to engage with us, we can assure you that we will not try to sell you on anything you don’t need. We believe that the most effective client relationship are forged out of self-discovery. We simply have a conversation about your time, money, and effort – and let you decide how you want to use them. Most of our clients didn’t pursue formal education in or want to spend time learning financial planning concepts, so they use their money to save time, effort, and headaches. Just with our explanation of our philosophy, everything comes down to trade-offs regarding limited resources – you just have to determine what is worth the most to you.

  <p>
    Recognizing that your time and human capital are some of your most valuable resources, we have consciously streamlined our service offering to facilitate relationships virtually so that we are available for you no matter where life takes you!
    Let’s have a conversation about how you can leverage our expertise to create time and mental bandwidth for you to be your best-self for the people who are important to you.
