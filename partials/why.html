      <p class="quote">
        “It is not the creation of wealth that is wrong, but the love of money for its own sake.” – Margaret Thatcher

      We serve as a reminder that there is a significant difference between Wealth and money. To us, Wealth is a state of subjective well-being – the pursuit and culmination of life’s passions, experiences, struggles, contributions, and triumphs – which comes from within and is founded in a sense of gratitude for what was, what is, and what might be. Money on the other hand, while necessary to thrive in 21st century America, is simply a tool to efficiently exchange an individual’s resources (skills, knowledge, time, effort, property, etc.) for the desired resources that another individual can provide. Conflating the two can muddy priorities, leading to a misallocation of resources that move an individual forward but in the wrong direction, and ultimately result in a lack of genuine fulfillment with life.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that the power of financial planning exists in this dichotomy; Wealth is infinite – money is not. A focus on building Wealth encourages individuals to live life with an abundance mentality, emphasizing resourcefulness instead of resources. The stewardship mindset reinforces gratitude for the resources available and enhances creativity for how to leverage those resources, promoting an awareness of what we can control and a focus on being present for every step of the journey. This encourages individuals to measure their lives other than in dollars and cents.

    <h5 class="sub-header-two"> Personal Journey : </h5>

    <div>
      <p>
        It’s easy to look back at life and craft a story about how making the right decisions and working hard afforded me to be where I am and have the opportunities that I do. However, to the extent my recollections of events and accomplishments are accurate, most stories tend to focus too much on the protagonist and would be better served by a perspective that credits those who helped along the journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Raised in a small town in Virginia, I was blessed to grow up in a great family with loving and encouraging parents, a roof over my head, homecooked meals on the table, and good schools to attend. To ensure stability and other opportunities for my sister and I, both parents worked incredibly hard; for years, this meant juggling multiple jobs so we could explore and learn. However, other than providing necessities for our family, money and status were never a priority over meaning and contributing to our community. Rather than material things, they emphasized stewardship for our blessings and giving back out of gratitude. Unfortunately, my dad got sick and after years of fighting he passed away during my sophomore year of high school. Circumstances required me to get a job to ease some of the financial burden, and that experience magnified my interest in business and finance. When the opportunity was available, I happily took a personal finance class in the mornings before school. It was the first time I realized that there was a field of study devoted to financial well-being and purposeful decision-making to achieve a desired future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two years later I was pursuing a degree in Finance at Virginia Tech with a concentration in Financial Planning and was actively involved in every related opportunity. These experiences opened doors to learn from and build relationships with many of the top minds in the profession. Their passion for helping people transcend circumstances was contagious, but I also learned that the profession, being relatively young, had a lot of progress ahead. Always being one to challenge the status quo, I had ideas about how the profession could truly have an impact. Witnessing how much my parents could contribute to the lives of those they knew without significant financial means personifies resourcefulness, and is the spark for my optimism about the power of quality Financial Planning. However, most financial advisors wouldn’t work with people like my parents because they couldn’t afford products that provided strong commissions for the salesman and didn’t have enough assets for a financial advisor to manage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developing as a young planner, I struggled with the gap between where the financial planning profession is and where it can be. Unfortunately, most people have experienced similar stresses associated with scarcity, and it isn’t right that many don’t have equal opportunities to pursue self-actualization and impact the world in their own unique way. Curiosity and a lot of effort within this space lead to an opportunity to launch my own financial planning firm focused on emulating the values learned growing up and building on ideas absorbed from great minds along the way.
