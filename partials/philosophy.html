    The Financial Planning profession’s reason for being is to help clients journey through life with a sense of abundance and subjective well-being. To serve in this capacity, it is important to consider how individuals explore life and pursue goals – a concept psychologists refer to as motivational theories. For illustrative purposes, consider the most popular approach - Maslow’s extended hierarchy of needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our basic needs as human beings are also called deficiency needs because when they are not met, we become stressed out an anxious. Since these efforts often provide instant gratification toward filling a need, they are also classified as coping behaviors and are generally not long-term solutions for fulfillment. It is theorized that an individual’s needs motivate behavior in a way that one must satisfy the lower level deficiency needs before they are able to pursue and meet the higher level needs. As a need is fulfilled, one has the mental bandwidth and willpower available to focus on other areas of life that are important.
  </p>
  <p>
    The higher level growth needs are tricky because the gratification afforded is generally not as intense or instantaneous, but satisfying these needs provides satisfaction and fulfillment that – bringing about true happiness.
  </p>
  <h5>What does this have to do with Financial Planning?</h5>
  <p>
    As we have all experienced, the unfortunate reality of life is that our vision of progress is often disrupted by life’s events, making it difficult to keep basic needs met consistently. Life experiences beyond our control – injury and sickness, loss of a job, vehicle or home repairs, relocation due to employment, divorce, etc. – all impact an individual’s position along the hierarchy because as life events unfold, new needs are presented. Financial Planning offers a framework through which individuals can navigate life by limiting the feeling of scarcity brought about with unfavorable events – thus, creating the space to hold onto an abundance mentality and that sense of well-being.
  </p>
  <p>
    Scarcity mentality creates a drag, like a tax, on mental bandwidth. Psychologists have observed that if the mind is hyper-focused on one need, the awareness, self-control, and long-term planning needed to fulfill other needs will not be sufficiently available. While the effects of physical scarcity (food, money, water, sleep) are limited to the specific areas they touch, a scarcity mindset bleeds into all areas of life, driving thoughts and actions to satisfy short-term needs at the expense of the future. This means that resources are allocated toward filling cracks in a foundation instead of building upon previous efforts.
  </p>

  <h5>How is Financial Planning a Solution?</h5>

  <p>
    Mirroring the deficiency needs and growth needs of Maslow’s theory of motivation, Financial Planning offers framework divided in the realms of resilience and stewardship.
  </p>
  <p>
    We refer to the focus on resilience as Financial Hygiene – ensuring there are no chinks in an individual’s armor and that there is a quality foundations off of which to build the rest of their life. While there is no expectation to anticipate every life event, taking deliberate actions to mitigate risk or the severity of the impact to an individual’s life trajectory is vital.

    As a simple example, consider the impact to cash flow in the event of a significant car or home repair. Squeezing a few thousand dollars out of a household’s monthly income can be difficult, and the only feasible solution may be breaking the cost into manageable monthly payments using credit cards or a loan. While this Band-Aid approach offers a short-term fix, the interest owed and ongoing monthly payments can significantly limit the flexibility of cash flow in future months. In this instance, having proactively emphasized measures to build resilience would enable the cost of the repair to come from an Emergency Fund so that an individual wouldn’t have the impact to cash flow or the stress associated with those additional payments.

  </p>
  <p>
    If Financial Hygiene is focused on maintaining the foundation, stewardship is embodied by an authentic prioritization resources toward actions and potential futures. As described in our Vision Statement (link), resources include things like skills, know-how, time, effort, and money – all of which can be leveraged in pursuit of the higher level needs. The nuance, and most enjoyable part about financial planning, is building relationships with individuals to learn more about their unique growth needs and vision for their lives. This enables us to understand more deeply how an individual wants to utilize their resources so we can help evaluate trade-offs and offer clarity on the steps necessary to build off of the foundation they worked so hard to create. Simply put, financial planning is a lens through which an individual’s needs and goals can be presented in terms of resources so the individual can make an authentic and informed decision on how they would like to use their resources in pursuit of subjective well-being.
